                    <h2>How does<br>it work?</h2>
                    <p>The process of playing a record involves placing the vinyl disc on the platter and gently lowering the tonearm onto the record. As the record spins, the stylus (needle) follows the grooves on the record, converting the physical variations in the grooves into electrical signals. These electrical signals are then amplified and sent to the speakers, producing the music or sound for us to enjoy.</p>
                    <p>The intricacy and precision of the mechanical components in a record player are essential in faithfully reproducing the audio stored on vinyl records and delivering a rich and warm listening experience.</p>
