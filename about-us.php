            <p>At Georgian Records, we are a group of music enthusiasts who share a passion for the vintage sound of LPs. Our story began when five friends â€“ Leonardo, Lucas, Marcos, Megumi and Renata - met during an exciting Computer Programming Course. Inspired by our mutual love for music, we decided to combine our skills and create a company that could provide music lovers with the authentic experience of vinyl records, recapturing the charm and sonic richness lost in the digital age.</p>
